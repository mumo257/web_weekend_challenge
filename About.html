            <p>Our Journey
                The Power Learn Initiative launched the #1Milliondevs4Africa program in April 2022 to make tech
                skills accessible and affordable to young Africans.
                We set out to scale the impact of the program to 5 counties 
                in Kenya, Siaya, Nakuru, Eldoret, & Kiambu. By June 2022, the 
                program had already attracted 1000 applicants from across Kenya
                who were ready to take advantage of this unique opportunity.
                By the end of the year, the program had expanded its reach to
                include South Africa, Zambia, Tanzania, and Nigeria, in pursuit
                of its goal to make tech skills available throughout the continent.
                Currently, we have graduated 1000 students from Kenya, with over
                7,000 learners from across our pilot countries enrolled in our unique learning platform.</p>
